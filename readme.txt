Prediction script does not require the checkpoint as a required input, the folders in current working directory are automatically searched to find .pth files. If necessary you can use --checkpoint to select the checkpoint, otherwise the script creates a menu with all the available checkpoints. The hyperparameters for the model are collected in the saved_data folder in a log file, these hyperparameters are not added to the checkpoint and instead stored in the log file.
